- 👋 Hi, I’m @SweetlessOwO, and I'm 19 years old who is still looking at colleges. In my high school years I was in Manufacturing class for 3 years where we did CAD, coding,
3D printer, Salder, and used arduino in order to create multiple different things. I enjoyed my class, from designing to programing, and I want to just do both there's just so
much aspects to developing something and make into reality so, usually you can't do that and be assigned to a role. 
- 👀 I’m interested in anime, art, video games, digital audio, graphic design, game development, game design, computer engineer, & almost anything involving art & tech.
- 🌱 I’m currently wanting to learn all these art/tech and looking into scholarship as well confuzzled which major I should go for.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding, and programming. Just looking for a mentor mainly, to learn these skills and be able to expand the tech industry with more females.
